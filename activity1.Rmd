# Introduction

Computers speak their own language known as 'machine code'. To humans this language is completely unreadable, so we needed to create something we could use to speak to computers. You can think of programming as a language that we use to talk to and be understood by computer. For comparison, imagine a situation where you speak English as your first language and French as your second. You meet someone who speaks German as their first language and French as their second, so you both have to communicate in French to understand each other!

<br> There are many programming languages, with different strengths and weaknesses. Like all languages you need to know the vocabulary and grammar, which can seem quite overwhelming at first. However, as you learn to program you develop your vocabulary problem solving skills. These problem solving skills are broadly applicable across all programming languages, so after learning one language you can learn a second much more easily!

These activities are designed to give you a first introduction to a programming language. We have selected python for you to learn as the 'code' (i.e. the vocabulary) was designed to be easier for humans to read and write. However, there is nothing stopping you from using the skills you've gained to learn a new programming language later on.

# replit

For these activities we will be using `replit`, a free web editor. Replit is an interactive way to write, test and edit your code. It also allows multiple people to collaborate at the same time. The link to it can be found here: <https://replit.com/>

You first need to create an account.

After this, Replit will ask you how familiar you are with programming. For now, we'll click 'no I've got this' as we can always return to these tutorials later.

We first need to create a 'repl' for this project.

<br>

We will be prompted to choose a language and give the project a title. Choose 'python' for the language. You can name the repl whatever you like but here I suggest 'CBF activity'. After you're done click '+ Create Repl' and we can begin our first coding activity.

# Hello world!

A program is a precise set of instructions (known as 'code') expressed in a programming language. The machine then translates this programming language into a form it can understand - machine code. We are now going to write our first python program using Replit.

There will already be a python script open called 'main.py'. We'll start by writing our code in this. The output of this script will appear on the right in the 'console'.

<br>

To begin, we will start with what is known as a 'Hello World!' script. These are usually the starting point of learning any programming language. Copy and paste (or type) the following code into 'main.py':

```{python, eval=FALSE}
print("hello world!")

```

Then click the green button that says 'run', your output should look something like this:

<br>

Our program used the function `print` to print out the text inside the quotation marks (this is equivalent to the `say` block in scratch). We could store this text in something known as a variable and then print this variable out.

An example of this is below. Note the lines that begin with '#', these are comments to remind us what our code does and aren't read by the interpreter.

```{python, eval=FALSE}

# Store our text inside a 'variable' called hello
hello = "hello world!"

# Print the variable hello
print(hello)

```

You can see that this code does the same thing:

Challenge: can you make the program print out something else? Anything you like.

<br> <br>

# Interactive inputs

Normally, we don't want our programs just to print out text. Some programs might expect user interaction. Next, we are going to write a program that prompts a user for an input, in this case your name. It stores the name in the variable 'name' and then prints the name out.

```{python, eval=FALSE}

# Use the 'input' function to ask the user to provide an input and store it in variable 'name'
name = input("Enter name: ")

# Print the variable hello
print("Hello, your name is", name)

```

<br>

Let's try and make this more complicated. We'll write a program that imagines you're having a conversation with a robot. It will first ask you for your name, then it will ask you to name it. The program will then print out your name and the name you gave it. Run the code below to try it.

```{python, eval=FALSE}

# Use the 'input' function to ask the user to provide an input and store it in variable 'name'
name1 = input("What is your name? : ")
name2 = input("What is my name? : ")

# Print the variable hello
print("Hello, your name is ", name1, " and my name is ", name2)

```

Challenge: can you create a program that takes <b>three</b> inputs and then prints out a statement that includes all three inputs?

<br> <br>

# Repeating code and running code out of order

Python will execute our program line by line, in order. We might have a piece of code we want to repeat over and over again. Or we might want to have all our code in one document and only run some of it, or run it in a different order. We can address all these scenarios using `functions`. 

A function is a block of code that only runs if it is called. We use the keyword def to declare a function, then follow it up with the function name. After that we begin a block of indented code underneath. These are lines of code that the function should then execute. 


Let's create a simple function using our code above:

```{python, eval=FALSE}

def robot_name():
  # Use the 'input' function to ask the user to provide an input and store it in variable 'name'
  name1 = input("What is your name? : ")
  name2 = input("What is my name? : ")
  
  # Print the variable hello
  print("Hello, your name is ", name1, " and my name is ", name2)

```

What happens if you run this code?

<br>

...
...

<br>

Nothing, yet!
A function needs to be called to run. 

Now try and run the below code: 

```{python, eval=FALSE}

def robot_name():
  # Use the 'input' function to ask the user to provide an input and store it in variable 'name'
  name1 = input("What is your name? : ")
  name2 = input("What is my name? : ")
  
  # Print the variable hello
  print("Hello, your name is ", name1, " and my name is ", name2)
  
  
robot_name()
robot_name()

```

It calls our function <i>twice</i> using `robot_name()`. This means the code inside the function is executed twice. 

Challenge (hard): try and create two custom functions. Give them their own names. Call the second function first, and the first function second. 

Can you see how this allows us to run code out of order? This will become very useful later when we try to make a 'create your own adventure' game. This works by linking different functions together!


# Conclusions

We have wrote our first python programs using replit - well done!
