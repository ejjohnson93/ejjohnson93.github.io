# Introduction to replit

For these activities we will be using `replit`, a free online IDE. An IDE (integrated development environment) is an interactive way to test our code. Replit is just one of many, the link to it can be found here: <https://replit.com/>

You first need to create an account.

After this, Replit will ask you how familiar you are with programming. For now, we'll click 'no I've got this' as we can always return to these tutorials later.

We first need to create a 'repl' for this project.

We will be prompted to choose a language and give the project a title. Choose 'python' for the language. You can name the repl whatever you like but here I suggest 'CBF activity'. After you're done click '+ Create Repl' and we can begin our first coding activity.

# Hello world!

We are now going to write our first program using Replit.

There will already be a python script open called 'main.py'. We'll start by writing our code in this. The output of this script will appear on the right in the 'console'.

To begin, we will start with what is known as a 'Hello World!' script. These are usually the starting point of learning any programming language. Copy and paste (or type) the following code into 'main.py':

```{python, eval=FALSE}
print("hello world!")

```

Then click the green button that says 'run', your output should look something like this:

Our program used the command `print` to print out the text inside the quotation marks. We could store this text in something known as a variable and then print this variable out.

An example of this is below. Note the lines that begin with '#', these are comments to remind us what our code does and aren't read by the interpreter.

```{python, eval=FALSE}

# Store our text inside a 'variable' called hello
hello = "hello world!"

# Print the variable hello
print(hello)

```

You can see that this code does the same thing:
