# Print a poem in python

Let's write a python program that will print out each line of a poem. Here we will use <i>"Hope" is the thing with feathers</i> by Emily Dickinson.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
print("Hope is the thing with feathers—")
print("That perches in the soul—")
print("And sings the tune without the words—")
print("And never stops—at all—")

```

The output of this program will appear in the terminal like this:
