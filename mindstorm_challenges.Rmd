We are now going to divide you into teams. Work as a team to complete the following challenges, don't worry if you don't manage them all. If you get stuck on one feel free to move onto another.

You can code the program using the word blocks OR python - whichever your team would prefer!
If you're using Python the [Motors and movement](mindstorm4.html) and [colours and control](mindstorm5.html) will contain code you might be able to adapt. 

I'll award a prize to the team that writes the best program!

<br><br>

## Move backwards

Write a program that will cause your robot to move backwards when its 'eyes' (the distance sensor are covered). 

<br>

## React to lines and obstacles 

Write a program that will have your robot react as it crosses different coloured lines. I've placed down red and black masking tape. Have each of these trigger something different, for example: a face on the light up matrix. (See python \> hub \> light matrix \> `hub.show_image()` if you're using Python). 

<br>

## Create a robot than can escape a box of red or black tape

I've created a box of red tape on the floor with a gap in, try and create a program that will allow the robot to navigate it's way out, starting from a random position inside the box. 

<br>

## Create your own program!

Try and create your own program. Example ideas:

-   Dancing robot

-   Animation on the light matrix

-   Play a song

-   Make a noise and pull a face on the light matrix when it nearly collides with an obstacle

-   Show a random number on the light matrix when the left or right button is pressed on the hub (you could expand on this to show the faces of a dice)
